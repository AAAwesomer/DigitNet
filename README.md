# DigitNet

Recurrent neural net trained using the MNIST data set. You can test it on your own pngs, it processes them for you, and forms a prediction
on the digit displayed.
I have also included a few pngs I drew on pixelmator for you to test out.

To test the algorithm on an image, just set the variable "image" equal to the path to your image:

	image = "./threernn"

Accuracy: 98.5%
